# Info

This code (in this folder) may be outdated. I'll update it later.
At the moment (01/07/2024) I'm working on **src-mongoose**. Although the code there is still raw (at least - this version does not support $options from mongoose), you can change it to suit your needs) (I don't mind)

Packages used: typeorm, pg, typescript, @types/node

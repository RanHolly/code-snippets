# code-snippets

This is a repository with some of my code snippets, ranging from simple utility functions like the one below to more complex code.

```javascript
function time() {
  const date = new Date();
  const hour = date.getHours().toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const minute = date.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, '0');
  const second = date.getSeconds().toString().padStart(2, '0');
  return `${ hour }:${ minute }:${ second }`;
}
```

These code snippets serve various purposes and were either implemented by me or inspired by other sources but implemented in my unique way.While not all of the code here may be completely unique due to the nature of the core features and methods of JavaScript(or any other language that appears in one of the passages), each snippet reflects my own approach and implementation style(although some implementations may be bad code... but I hope that I will have about 0 such "code")).
Some of these snippets were created with the assistance of GPT - 3.5, which I use to clarify programming issues, seek examples, or receive minor clarifications.

Please note that if you recognize your code here, it might be because GPT suggested it to me or I found it on the Internet, not necessarily on GitHub.

Feel free to explore and use these code snippets for your projects!
